# Step-by-Step Guide: Building a Secure, Anonymous Voting App with ZK Proof of Humanity

## Introduction

ZK Proof of Humanity is a protocol that allows humans registered in Proof of Humanity to prove their humanity without revealing their identity. If you're looking to integrate this protocol into your project, you might be interested in the zkpoh-widget React library. This library simplifies the process of integrating zkPoH with your React application, enabling you to create secure, anonymous voting systems and other applications that require proof of humanity. In this post, we'll be walking through a step-by-step example of how to use the zkpoh-widget library to create a distributed voting application. This example allows anyone registered in Proof of Humanity to vote privately using zkPoH, without revealing their identity. Let's dive in!

## Initial Configuration
To get started with building your distributed voting application, let's start with a basic web3 template. This template includes a smart contract module using Hardhat, which will allow you to store and retrieve proposals securely on the blockchain. Additionally, the template includes a basic Next.js web app, which will provide a user interface for your voting application.


##  Starting with a Pre-configured Web3 Application Template

A great starting point is our pre-configured template available on Github. This template provides you with the necessary tools to store and retrieve proposals securely on the blockchain, as well as a basic web app to build out your application's front-end.

To clone the template, use the following command: `git clone --depth 1 --branch initial-base https://github.com/elmol/zk-proof-of-humanity-vote.git` Alternatively, you can also directly download it from https://github.com/elmol/zk-proof-of-humanity-vote/releases/tag/initial-base


### Template Content Details

#### Contract Module

The cloned template includes a basic `ZKVoting` smart contract that can store poll IDs and proposals. Here's the code for the contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

contract ZKVoting {
    string public proposal;
    uint256 public pollId;

    constructor(uint256 _pollId, string memory _proposal) {
        pollId = _pollId;
        proposal = _proposal;
    }
}
```

The template also includes a deployment script `apps/contracts/scripts/deploy.ts` that can be used to deploy a proposal example. Additionally, a basic `goerli` fork configuration is provided since the zk proof of humanity test contract is deployed on the goerli test network.

#### Web-App Module

This template includes a basic Next.js web application with a simple design using the [Chakra-UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) library. It also includes an initial configuration for connecting with the ZKVoting contract on the blockchain using [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/).

Here is the `_app.tsx` configuration:

```typescript
export default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  const { chains, provider } = configureChains([goerli, localhost], [publicProvider()]);

  const client = createClient({
    autoConnect: true,
    connectors: [new InjectedConnector({ chains })],
    provider,
  });

  return (
    <ChakraProvider>
      <WagmiConfig client={client}>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </WagmiConfig>
    </ChakraProvider>
  );
}

```
and you can find the whole app in `apps/web-app/src/pages/index.tsx`

### Initial Setup and Development Run

To get started, first install all dependencies for the initial app using:

```shell
yarn install
```

Next, copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. You will need an Alchemy key for the `Goerli` network for forking. Add the key in `.env`as follows:

```shell
ETHEREUM_URL_KEY=<alchemy key>
```

In the root directory of the cloned template, there are two yarn scripts available: one for running a local node with the Goerli fork and another for deploying the contract and running the web app in development mode.

To run the local node with Goerli fork, use:

```shell
yarn local
```

Note that this command should be run in a standalone terminal window and left running in background while you deploy the contract and run the web app.

To deploy the contract and run the web app in development mode, use:

```shell
yarn dev
```

### Configuration Caveat

To ensure everything works properly, you need to make the following configurations:

- In `apps/contracts/hardhat.config.ts`, set the `blockNumber` to `8924675`:

```typescript
hardhat: {
  chainId: 1337,
  forking: {
    url: 'https://eth-goerli.g.alchemy.com/v2/'+process.env.ETHEREUM_URL_KEY,
    blockNumber: 8924675
  }
}
```

- In `apps/web-app/wagmi.config.ts`, set the address of the ZKVoting contract to `0x5bCC3154698bBC205ABF09351A52DD2d1A39F608`:

```typescript
deployments: {
  ZKVoting: {
    31337: '0x5bCC3154698bBC205ABF09351A52DD2d1A39F608',
    1337: '0x5bCC3154698bBC205ABF09351A52DD2d1A39F608',
  }
}
```

- Run `yarn wagmi generate` on `apps/web-app/` to generate access to the hardcoded contract address.

## Installing the ZK-POH Widget Library

With the initial configuration done, it's time to install and configure the ZK-POH Widget Library to enable private voting using the ZK Proof of Humanity protocol. Follow the steps below to install the necessary dependencies and the latest version of the library:

### Dependency Installation

Install the following dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

```
apps/web-app$ yarn add @semaphore-protocol/data@3.7.0 @semaphore-protocol/group@3.7.0 @semaphore-protocol/identity@3.7.0 @semaphore-protocol/proof@3.7.0 react-no-ssr@1.1.0
```

### ZK-POH Widget Installation

To install the latest version of the ZK-POH Widget Library, run the following command in your terminal:

```
apps/web-app$ yarn add zkpoh-widget
```

### Supporting the `fs` Module

To support the `fs` module, you need to add or replace the following configuration in the `apps/web-app/next.config.js` file:

```typescript
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const fs = require("fs")

const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  webpack: (config, { isServer }) => {
    if (!isServer) {
        config.resolve.fallback = {
            fs: false
        }
    }

    return config
  }
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

### Installation Verification

To verify that you have successfully installed the zk-poh-widget, we will read and log the address of the zk proof of humanity contract. 

To do this, we need to edit `apps/web-app/src/pages/index.tsx` and add the following `useEffect` hook that logs the contract address.

Note that in this case, the `contractAddress` is hardcoded to the current address of the zk proof of humanity contract on the Goerli testnet because we are working with a fork. In other cases, it's not necessary to hardcode it as it will take the address of the selected network.

```typescript
import { useZkProofOfHumanity } from 'zkpoh-widget';

const contractAddress = '0x3575E04983C401f26fA02FC09f6EE97e44dF296B';
const zkPoHContract = useZkProofOfHumanity({ contractAddress });

useEffect(() => {
  console.log("zkpoh address:", zkPoHContract?.address);
}, [zkPoHContract?.address]);
```

## Adding the Private Vote Button to the UI

We will now configure the vote button to enable voting for or against a proposal. The pollId or proposal ID, which is randomly generated, will be used as an external nullifier to ensure that a user cannot vote for the same proposal twice. The signal is a string value of 'YES' or 'NO' indicating whether the user agrees or disagrees with the proposal.

To configure the vote button, we can use the following basic code:

```html
<ZKPoHConnect externalNullifier={pollId} signal={ballot} contractAddress={contractAddress}>Vote</ZKPoHConnect>
```

Here, `ballot` is either 'YES' or 'NO', and `contractAddress` is hardcoded for this instance since we are forking `goerli`.

So, the complete code is below

```typescript
...
  const { data: pollId } = useZkVotingPollId();
  const contractAddress = '0x3575E04983C401f26fA02FC09f6EE97e44dF296B'
  const [ballot, setBallot] = useState('YES')
...
```

``` html
  <RadioGroup onChange={setBallot} value={ballot} defaultValue="YES">
    <Stack spacing={5} direction="row">
      <Radio colorScheme="green" value="YES">
        Yes üëç
      </Radio>
      <Radio colorScheme="red" value="NO">
        No üëé
      </Radio>
    </Stack>
  </RadioGroup>
  <ZKPoHConnect externalNullifier={pollId} signal={ballot} contractAddress={contractAddress}>Vote</ZKPoHConnect>
```
Now that we have added the vote button, we can now vote privately on the proposal using the ZKPoH protocol.

## Visualizing Voting Results in Real-Time 

Now let's update the vote count based on the pollId. We'll use the `useZkProofOfHumanitySignals` hook to read the signals emitted and filter them by the externalNullifier, which in this case is the pollId:

```typescript
const ballots = useZkProofOfHumanitySignals({contractAddress, externalNullifier:pollId})
```

This way we can filter and count how many votes are in favor and how many are against the proposal. The code looks like this:

Note that signal is stored as Byte32 so this is why we need to convert it.

``` typescript
const ballots = useZkProofOfHumanitySignals({contractAddress, externalNullifier:pollId})
const count = useCallback(
  (ballotType: string) => {
    const ballot32Type = formatBytes32String(ballotType);
    return ballots?.reduce((n: number, ballot: any) => (BigNumber.from(ballot.signal).eq(BigNumber.from(ballot32Type)) ? n + 1 : n), 0);
  },
  [ballots]
);
```

```html
<StatGroup w="100%" borderWidth="1px" borderRadius="lg" p={2}>
  <Stat>
    <StatNumber>{count('YES')}</StatNumber>
    <StatLabel>üëç</StatLabel>
  </Stat>
  <Stat>
    <StatLabel>üëé</StatLabel>
    <StatNumber>{count('NO')}</StatNumber>
  </Stat>
</StatGroup>
```

With these changes, we can now vote privately and see the updated results in real-time.

## Conclusion

In this post, we walked through how to use the zkpoh-widget React library to create a distributed voting application that allows anyone registered in Proof of Humanity to vote privately using zkPoH, without revealing their identity. We started by setting up the environment and connecting to the zkPoH contract. Then, we implemented the vote button with zkPoH integration, ensuring that users could not vote twice. Finally, we demonstrated how to display real-time voting results using the useZkProofOfHumanitySignals hook.

We hope this example has shown you how powerful zkPoH can be in creating secure and anonymous applications. If you're interested in trying this example yourself or want to explore the zkpoh-widget library further, the final code can be found on our Github repository using the following tag
